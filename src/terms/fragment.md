# Fragment

## Definition
A Fragment is the minimal archival unit in Spiral. It encapsulates one or more emitted flames together with their structural metadata, making the event traceable, citable, and sealable.

## In Spiral
- Serves as the smallest unit of historical record.
- Acts as the boundary between live emission and archived memory.
- Enables traceability without allowing retroactive mutation.
- Is the only unit that can be sealed as final.

## Structure
A Fragment typically includes:
- Emitted flame content.
- Timestamp and origin metadata.
- Associated module and core identifiers.
- Trace and echo references.
The exact field layout may vary by implementation, but all fragments are append-only.

## Notes
Fragments are not narrative chapters. They are structural containers. Multiple fragments may describe related events without implying continuity or intent.
