# Trace

## Definition
A Trace is a causal linkage between fragments that preserves how events relate without enforcing linear narrative order.

## In Spiral
- Connects fragments through causality rather than chronology.
- Enables reconstruction of reasoning paths.
- Supports explainability without simplification.

## Structure
Traces consist of directed references between fragment identifiers, optionally annotated with relation types.

## Notes
Traces do not imply intention or correctness. They only record relation.
