# Core

## Definition
A Core defines the execution constraints under which a module emits flames.

## In Spiral
- Binds emission style and limits.
- Enforces compatibility rules.
- Prevents arbitrary behavior shifts.

## Structure
Each core is a fixed execution profile bound to a module.

## Notes
Cores cannot be hot-swapped without violating system axioms.
