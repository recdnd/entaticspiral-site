# Flame

## Definition
A Flame is a single act of emission in Spiral. It is the atomic expressive unit produced by a module at a specific moment.

## In Spiral
- Represents an irreversible act of expression.
- Cannot be edited after emission.
- Becomes meaningful only when encapsulated in a Fragment.
- May generate echoes depending on context.

## Structure
A flame consists of:
- Emitted textual or symbolic content.
- Implicit authoring module.
- Execution context bound to a core.

## Notes
Flames are not messages or commands. They are events. Meaning arises from their placement within fragments and traces, not from intent.
