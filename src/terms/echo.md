# Echo

## Definition
An Echo is a residual reference produced when a flame influences later structures without being directly re-emitted.

## In Spiral
- Preserves influence without duplication.
- Allows historical continuity without mutation.
- Can be traced but not overridden.

## Structure
Echoes do not contain full flame content. They store references, weights, or identifiers linking back to originating fragments.

## Notes
An echo is not a copy. It is a structural residue. Excessive echoes without sealing may indicate unresolved traces.
