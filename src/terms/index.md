# Terms

> Canonical terminology index for the Spiral language field.

The Terms section provides authoritative definitions of all core concepts in the Spiral system. Each term is structured as a citable, indexable entry with formal definitions, structural characteristics, and relationships to other terms.

## What are Terms?

Terms in Spiral are not informal descriptions. They are formal definitions that:

- Establish canonical vocabulary for the language field
- Provide citable references for research and implementation
- Maintain historical traceability through versioning
- Link to related concepts and governing laws

### Record and Memory

These terms describe how events are emitted, stored, and referenced.

- [Fragment](/terms/fragment/) - The minimal archival unit encapsulating emitted flames and metadata
- [Flame](/terms/flame/) - An atomic act of irreversible emission
- [Echo](/terms/echo/) - A residual reference produced by influence without re-emission
- [Trace](/terms/trace/) - A causal linkage between fragments
- [Append-only](/terms/append-only/) - A storage and recording principle forbidding mutation of past records

### Authority and Governance

These terms define institutional control and finality.

- [Sovereignty](/terms/sovereignty/) - The indivisible authority unit governing definition and sealing
- [Seal](/terms/seal/) - A governance act that marks a fragment as final and immutable
- [RWX](/terms/rwx/) - The permission model for read, write, and execution access

### Architecture and Execution

These terms describe operational structure and constraints.

- [Module](/terms/module/) - An operational entity capable of emitting flames
- [Core](/terms/core/) - An execution constraint profile bound to a module
- [Glyph](/terms/glyph/) - A symbolic marker representing modules or authority

### Interpretation and View

These terms describe derived perspectives over recorded history.

- [Recent View (RECENT_A)](/terms/recent-view/) - A computed perspective surfacing the most relevant causal state
