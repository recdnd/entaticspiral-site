# Axioms

This page lists the foundational axioms governing Spiral systems.  
These axioms are constraints, not suggestions.

---

## Axiom 1: Irreversibility of emission

Once a flame is emitted, it cannot be modified or revoked.

---

## Axiom 2: Append-only record

All records are append-only.  
Correction occurs through new fragments, not mutation.

---

## Axiom 3: Fragment as minimal archival unit

Only fragments may be sealed, traced, or archived.  
No smaller unit is historically valid.

---

## Axiom 4: Separation of emission and governance

Entities that emit expressions do not inherently possess authority to finalize or override them.

---

## Axiom 5: Sovereignty is indivisible

Sovereignty cannot be duplicated, simulated, or partially assigned.

---

## Axiom 6: Sealing implies finality, not deletion

Sealing marks a fragment as complete and immutable.  
It does not remove it from history.

---

## Axiom 7: Trace preserves causality, not intention

Traces record relation, not correctness, belief, or purpose.

---

## Axiom 8: Computed views do not alter records

Derived perspectives such as Recent View interpret history without modifying it.

---

## Notes

- Violating an axiom invalidates system compatibility.
- Axioms may be extended but not contradicted.
- Detailed legal formulations are documented in the Sovereignty System Law.
