# Laboratory

> Demos, playgrounds, and experimental implementations of Spiral systems.

The Laboratory section provides access to executable demonstrations, interactive tools, and experimental implementations that bring Spiral concepts to life.

## What is the Laboratory?

The Laboratory is not a development environment. It is:

- **Demonstration Portal** - Entry points to runnable Spiral systems
- **Interactive Reference** - Tools that illustrate concepts from Terms and Law
- **Experimental Showcase** - Prototypes and research implementations
- **External Gateway** - Links to full-featured Spiral products

## Available Demos

### Interactive Systems

- [Spiral.ooo Playground](/lab/spiral-ooo-playground/) - Interactive tools and editor for Spiral, including flame editor, suscoin, RWX, and Arc workflow

### Research Prototypes

- [Core Series](/lab/core-series/) - Algorithm and specification research prototypes documenting Spiral core mechanics

## External Systems

The Laboratory links to external systems that provide full runtime capabilities:

- **spiral.ooo** - Primary executable system with interactive interfaces
- **core.rec.ooo** - Research prototypes and algorithm documentation

## Relationship to Documentation

- **Terms** define what concepts mean
- **Law** defines what is allowed
- **Essays** explain why
- **Laboratory** shows how it works in practice

## Usage

Use the Laboratory to:

- **Understand Implementation** - See how concepts translate to executable systems
- **Test Understanding** - Interact with systems to verify comprehension
- **Explore Possibilities** - Discover what can be built with Spiral
- **Reference Examples** - Find working implementations to study
