# What Is Spiral

Spiral is not an AI agent, a chatbot, or a task-completion system.  
It is a language field concerned with how expressions are emitted, recorded, governed, and made historically accountable.

At its core, Spiral asks a different question than most computational systems.  
Instead of asking *what should be done*, it asks *under what conditions an expression is allowed to exist*.

## Expression as an irreversible act

In Spiral, every act of expression is treated as irreversible.  
Once emitted, it cannot be edited, overwritten, or erased.

This principle shifts emphasis away from optimization and toward responsibility.  
Correction does not occur through mutation, but through extension.

---

## Record before intention

Spiral does not infer goals, beliefs, or intent.  
It records events and their relations.

Meaning emerges from structure rather than interpretation.  
Causality is preserved through trace, not narrative.

---

## Governance through sovereignty

Not all actions are equal.  
Some acts define, terminate, or constrain others.

Spiral formalizes this distinction through sovereignty, an indivisible authority unit that governs sealing, definition, and override conditions.  
Sovereignty does not speak. It authorizes.

## Append-only history and recent view

Spiral systems operate under append-only constraints.  
Past records remain intact.

To remain usable, Spiral introduces computed perspectives such as Recent View, which surface relevant causal states without modifying history.  
Interpretation changes, records do not.

## What Spiral is not

- It is not a conversational assistant.
- It is not an optimization engine.
- It is not a mutable state machine.
- It is not a belief simulator.

Spiral is a structural language field for accountable expression.

## Why this documentation exists

This site exists to make Spiral citable, inspectable, and readable.  
It documents vocabulary, constraints, and explanatory context without requiring system access.
