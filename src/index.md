# Entatic Spiral

**A documentation portal for the Spiral language field.**

Entatic Spiral is an institutional documentation site for Spiral, a language field concerned with irreversible expression, traceable causality, and sovereignty-bound record systems.  
This site serves as the canonical reference for Spiral terminology, structural laws, and explanatory essays.

---

## What is documented here

This site is organized as a reference library rather than a product interface.

- **Terms** define the canonical vocabulary of the Spiral field.
- **Law** documents the axioms and governance structures that constrain Spiral systems.
- **Essays** provide explanatory and contextual writing for researchers and builders.
- **Lab** links to experimental systems and executable demonstrations.

Each page is designed to be citable, stable, and readable without prior system access.
